# Virtual-Screening-of-natural-compounds-Targeting-MAO-B-A-computational-Approach-for-Parkinson-
The aim of this project was to utilize computational tools to identify potential natural inhibitors of Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B), a key therapeutic target in Parkinsonâ€™s disease, through virtual screening and interaction analysis.
